#Solution


## Exercise 1


If you create a new placemark - and set it location, note that when you click on the marker it shows its lar/long. Move it around - and notice that the lat/long in the panel never changes (even though it is at a different location).

See if you can fix this - such that it always shows the correct location.

(HINT: look up `GoogleMap.OnMarkerClickListener` and `setSnippet`)


## Exercise 2

The location is not currently stored in the PlacemarkModel, so when you edit a placemark, it is back at the default location.

Fix this by making location part of the placemark model, so we can edit and change the locations for existing markers.
