# Recover Location from Activity

Currently, when you press back from the MapsActivity, any change made in the marker by the user us lost. We need to address this now.

First, make these changes to ActivityPlacemark class members:

## PlacemarkActivity

~~~
  val LOCATION_REQUEST = 2
  var location = Location(52.245696, -7.139102, 15f)
~~~

When we start the map, we pass the LOCATION_REQUEST  code:

~~~
   placemarkLocation.setOnClickListener {
      startActivityForResult(intentFor<MapsActivity>().putExtra("location", location), LOCATION_REQUEST)
    }
~~~

Now, when a result is returned, we detect a LOCATION_REQUEST response, and recover the location:

~~~
  override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    when (requestCode) {
      IMAGE_REQUEST -> {
        if (data != null) {
          placemark.image = data.getData().toString()
          placemarkImage.setImageBitmap(readImage(this, resultCode, data))
          chooseImage.setText(R.string.change_placemark_image)
        }
      }
      LOCATION_REQUEST -> {
        if (data != null) {
          location = data.extras.getParcelable<Location>("location")
        }
      }
    }
  }
~~~

Try the app now - and drag the marker to a new location.

When you press back - and you get to the PlacemarkActivity - try pressing Set Location again. What happens? It still doesn't seem to remember the new location.

To get this to work, we need further capabilities in MapsActivity.

First, implement a new interface:

## MapsActivity

~~~
class MapsActivity : AppCompatActivity(), OnMapReadyCallback,  GoogleMap.OnMarkerDragListener {
~~~

This interface requires three methods:

~~~
  override fun onMarkerDragStart(marker: Marker) {
  }

  override fun onMarkerDrag(marker: Marker) {
  }

  override fun onMarkerDragEnd(marker: Marker) {
    location.lat = marker.position.latitude
    location.lng = marker.position.longitude
    location.zoom = map.cameraPosition.zoom
  }
~~~

We are only interested in one of these methods for the moment.

Finally, we need to intercept the back button, and send it back to the parent activity:

~~~
  override fun onBackPressed() {
    val resultIntent = Intent()
    resultIntent.putExtra("location", location)
    setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, resultIntent)
    finish()
    super.onBackPressed()
  }
~~~

Try this now - and verify that if you change the location - and then immediately press back and then renter the map again - the location is remembered.
