# Solution

## Exercise 1:

Create an ArrayList of Placemarks in PlacemarkActivity - and add each new activity to this list.

Log all placemarks when a new one is entered.

HINT: Here is a simple placemark array declaration + creation:

~~~
  val placemarks = ArrayList<PlacemarkModel>()
~~~  

This is the documentation on lists in general:

- <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections.html>

Greater emphasis is placed here on mutability - which we can explore at a later stage.

## Exercise 2:

Create new text field `description` + log when entered. This will require you to:

- and a new field in the layout
- add a new entry in the strings.xml file
- expend the model
- recover the field in the event handler and include in the model objects
- log the new field

## Exercise 4:

Explore some of the anko dialogs:

- <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/collections.html>

Try them out in your event handler.
