# Solution

## Exercise 1:

Create List of Placemarks in PlacemarkActivity - and add each new activity to this list.

Log all placemarks when a new one is entered.

HINT: Here is a simple placemark array declaration + creation:

~~~
  val placemarks = ArrayList<PlacemarkModel>()
~~~  

This is the documentation on lists in general:

Greater emphasis is placed here on mutability - which we can explore at a later stage.

## Exercise 2:

Create new text field `description` + log when entered


## Exercise 4:

Explore some of the anko dialogs:

Try them out in your event handler.
