#Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [archive.zip](archives/archive.zip)


## Exercise 1

Incorporate new 'Cancel' action into `PlacemarkActivity`. This should return to PlacemarkList without adding a new Placemark, Use the `RESULT_CANCELED` return code.

Follow the steps 05 & 06 in this lab as a guide to doing this. Remember, you will be introducing the menu/action into PlacemarkActivity.

## Exercise 2

Introduce the following interface into the `models` package:

~~~
package org.wit.placemark.model

interface PlacemarkStore {
  fun findAll(): List<PlacemarkModel>
  fun create(placemark: PlacemarkModel)
}
~~~

## Exercise 3

Create a new class called `PlacemarkMemStore` to implement this interface. In MainApp, replace the ArrayList:

~~~
  val placemarks = ArrayList<PlacemarkModel>()
~~~

With an instance of an instance of your new class:

~~~
  val placemarkStore = PlacemarkMemStore()
~~~

Refactor PlacemrkActivity & PlacemarkListActivity to use this object instead of the current arrangement.

## Exercise 4

Introduce a new method in PlacemarkMemStore which will log all placemarks. Make this an internal method (not in the interface). Call it whenever a new placemark is added.
