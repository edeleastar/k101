# Exercises Solutions

## Exercise 1:

Create an ArrayList of Placemarks in PlacemarkActivity - and add each new activity to this list.

Log all placemarks when a new one is entered.

HINT: Here is a simple placemark array declaration + creation:

~~~
  val placemarks = ArrayList<PlacemarkModel>()
~~~  

## Solution

Even if you solved the problem - try this version:

~~~
class PlacemarkActivity : AppCompatActivity(), AnkoLogger {

  var placemark = PlacemarkModel()
  val placemarks = ArrayList<PlacemarkModel>()

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_placemark)

    btnAdd.setOnClickListener() {
      placemark.title = placemarkTitle.text.toString()
      if (placemark.title.isNotEmpty()) {
        placemarks.add(placemark)
        info("add Button Pressed: $placemarkTitle")
        placemarks.forEach { info("add Button Pressed: ${it.title}")}
      }
      else {
        toast ("Please Enter a title")
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

Look carefully at this statement:

~~~
        placemarks.forEach { info("add Button Pressed: ${it.title}")}
~~~

What is going on here? This is another example of a Kotlin lambda - this time as a parameter to a forEach function associated with a collection. Review these posts here to get a general feel for how to manipulate collections effectively:

Run the app with this solution - do you notice anything strange? You should see the every time we add a new placemark, we seem to log out the same value for all entries added. This is because we are only ever creating a single placemark :

~~~
  var placemark = PlacemarkModel()
~~~

Try this version of the add method instead:

~~~
        placemarks.add(placemark.copy())
~~~

Run again now and check the logs - each entry should be added now as expected.



## Exercise 2:

Create new text field `description` + log when entered. This will require you to:

- and a new field in the layout
- add a new entry in the strings.xml file
- expend the model
- recover the field in the event handler and include in the model objects
- log the new field


## Solution

## strings.xml

~~~
...
  <string name="hint_placemarkDescription">Description </string>
...  
~~~

## activity_placemark.xml

~~~
...
        <android.support.design.widget.TextInputEditText
            android:id="@+id/description"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_margin="8dp"
            android:hint="@string/hint_placemarkDescription"
            android:inputType="text"
            android:maxLength="25"
            android:maxLines="1"
            android:padding="8dp"
            android:textColor="@color/colorPrimaryDark"
            android:textSize="14sp"/>
...

Make sure to put this into the correct context.

## PlacemarkModel.kt

~~~
data class PlacemarkModel(var title: String = "",
                          var description: String = "")

~~~

## PlacemarkActivity.kt

~~~
...
      placemark.description = description.text.toString()
...
~~~

Again, make sure to put this into the correct context.
