## Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [archive.zip](archives/archive.zip)

## Exercise 1

Change back to using the PlacemarkMemStore instead of PlacemarkStoreRoom. The only change you need to make should be in MainApp.

Try some experiments to make sure the persistence is working as expected:

- Using MemStore - create some placemarks and then kill the app. Relaunch, and verify that all placemarks are gone
- Using RoomStore - try the same experiment. This time the placemarks should persist between application terminations.
