#Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [archive.zip](archives/archive.zip)

## Exercise 1

When you select a placemark from PlacemarkList Activity - it presents the activity in the PlacemarkActivity. If you edit the activity, and press 'Create' - a new activity is created and appended to the list.

Change this behaviour along the following lines:

- When PlacemarkActivity is opened in this way - the button label 'add placemark' should be named 'save placemark'
- pressing the button should update the existing placemark with the newly entered values, not create  new one. 

We have new features in PlacemarkStore to enable you to implement this. 

If you complete the implementation, you will notice that even if you update a Placemarks contents, the new contents will not be displayed in PlacemarkList. However, if you consult the logs you may be able to see if the values are actually changed. 

Exercise 2 below will modify PlacemarkList to always to show the latest placemark store.


## Exercise 2

## PlacemarkListActivity

~~~
  override fun onPlacemarkClick(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    startActivityForResult(intentFor<PlacemarkActivity>().putExtra("placemark_edit", placemark), 200)
  }

  override fun onOptionsItemSelected(item: MenuItem?): Boolean {
    when (item?.itemId) {
      R.id.item_add -> startActivityForResult<PlacemarkActivity>(200)
    }
    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item)
  }

  override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    recyclerView.adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
  }
