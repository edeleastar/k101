#Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [archive.zip](archives/archive.zip)

## Exercise 1

As a user, create a new placemark with a title + image. Now edit the placemark and change the title - and update the placemark. Notice that the title has changed in PlacemarkList. 

Edit the placemark and change the image - and update the placemark. Go back in to edit the placemark again - what image do you see?

There is a bug here - the placemark activity is still showing the original image. See if you can debug and fix this bug.

(HINT - look in the PlacemarkMemStore class)


## Exercise 2

in PlacemarkActivity, if you are editing a placemark OR if the placemark already has an image, change the button label to be 'Change Image'

## Exercise 3

Introduce a new ImageView into the PlaceMarkCard view (displayed on PlacemarkListAcivity). Display the placemark images here (if an image has been loaded)
