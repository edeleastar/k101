# Selecting Images

Create a folder called `org.wit.placemark.helpers`, and incorporate this class helper method:

## ImageHelpers

~~~
package org.wit.placemark.helpers

import android.app.Activity
import android.content.Intent
import org.wit.placemark.R

fun showImagePicker(parent: Activity, id: Int) {
  val intent = Intent()
  intent.type = "image/*"
  intent.action = Intent.ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT
  intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE)
  val chooser = Intent.createChooser(intent, R.string.select_placemark_image.toString())
  parent.startActivityForResult(chooser, id)
}
~~~

This function relies on this new string in strings.xml:

## strings.xml

~~~
<string name="select_placemark_image">Select placemark image</string>
~~~

Notice that this is just a function, not a class or an object. Its purpose is to show an image picker dialog. This particular approach is only available in API level 19 on, so we will need retain this as a minimum for or application build.

This picker is based on the Storage Access Framework (SAF) - discussed here:

- <https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html>

We will now trigger this dialog. When starting an activity like this, we usually define a special code - which we will expect the new activity to send back when it is finished (otherwise we might get confused as to which activity has just finished).

Here is the id we invent - make it a class member of PlacemakerActivity:

## PlacemakerActivity

~~~
  val IMAGE_REQUEST = 1
~~~

Then to trigger the picker:

~~~
    chooseImage.setOnClickListener {
      showImagePicker(this, IMAGE_REQUEST)
    }
~~~    

If there are no images in your simulator, you might want to launch a browser, find some images and save them to your camera roll (long press in chrome will trigger this).

Run the app now and verify that the picker does in fact appear, presenting a set of images for selection.
